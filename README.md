# Road-Accident-Analysis-Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of road accident data for the years 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides insights into casualty trends, accident severity, and the impact of various external factors such as weather, road type, and light conditions on traffic safety.

## 📂 Dataset Summary
The analysis tracks a total of **144.4K accidents** and **195.7K casualties** for the current year (CY).

### Key Dimensions Analyzed:
* **Casualty Severity:** Fatal, Serious, and Slight casualties.
* **Vehicle Type:** Cars, Bikes, Vans, Buses, Agricultural vehicles.
* **Environmental Factors:** Road Surface, Weather Conditions, Light Conditions (Day/Dark).
* **Geographic & Road Data:** Urban vs. Rural areas, Road Types (Single/Dual Carriageway), and Location (UK Map).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Power BI:** For building the interactive dashboard and map visualizations (Microsoft Bing integration).
* **Data Processing:** Analysis of current year (2022) vs previous year (2021) trends.

## 📊 Dashboard Insights

### 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The current year data shows a general decline in accidents and casualties compared to the previous year:
* **Total Casualties:** 195.7K (decreased by **11.9%**).
* **Total Accidents:** 144.4K (decreased by **11.7%**).
* **Fatal Casualties:** 2.9K, showing a significant drop of **33.3%**.
* **Serious Casualties:** 27.0K (down 16.2%).
* **Slight Casualties:** 165.8K (down 10.6%).

### 2. Vehicle & Road Analysis
* **Vehicle Involvement:**
    * **Cars** are involved in the vast majority of casualties (**155,804**), followed by **Vans** (15,905) and **Bikes** (15,610).
    * Agricultural vehicles account for a minor portion (399).
* **Road Type:**
    * **Single Carriageways** have the highest number of casualties, significantly higher than Dual Carriageways or Roundabouts.

### 3. Environmental & Geographic Factors
* **Urban vs. Rural:**
    * The majority of casualties occur in **Urban areas (61.95%)** compared to Rural areas (38.05%).
* **Light Conditions:**
    * **Daytime** accidents account for **73.84%** of casualties, while 26.16% occur in the Dark.
* **Location:** The analysis covers the United Kingdom, highlighting major hubs like **Glasgow, Dublin, Manchester, and Birmingham**.

## 🚀 Recommendations
Based on the data, the following safety measures are recommended:
1.  **Urban Safety Initiatives:** With ~62% of casualties occurring in urban zones, policy interventions should focus on city traffic management and pedestrian safety.
2.  **Daytime Traffic Control:** Despite lower visibility at night, nearly 74% of accidents happen during the day, suggesting a need for better congestion management during peak hours.
3.  **Single Carriageway Focus:** Infrastructure improvements should target single carriageways, which are the most accident-prone road type.
4.  **Motorcycle Awareness:** While cars dominate the volume, bikes (15.6K casualties) represent a vulnerable category requiring specific safety campaigns.
